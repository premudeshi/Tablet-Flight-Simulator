# Tablet Flight Simulator

<h2>About this Project</h2>
This project is an open source flight simulator project. It allows Flight Simmers to produce an low budget flight sim using hardware like tablets and Bluetooth to communicate with ardunio.

<h2>How it Works</h2>

This Flight Sim is based on Microsoft Flight Simulator X. The app works when you install the APK on your tablet device as well as connect and upload the code onto arudino. Arduino is an open source Microcontroller that is cheap and affective to work with. The board comes with it's own IDE which also makes it simple and Easier to upload code. To connect the Arduino and the Flight Sim we use <a href="http://www.jimspage.co.nz/intro.htm">Jim's Link2FS</a>. Which is also an Free and Open source software that works with FSX. 

<h2>Installation</h2>

Its simple to install. From the APK folder or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wjprets2ztxxsvr/ArduinoKeypad.apk?dl=0">download it From Dropbox</a>. Once you have done that, connect your Arduino to FSX using LINK2FS with the code in the Code folder (get the latest version). Open the App on android and connect the Bluetooth Module with the Phone. After that load up FSX and it should Work.
